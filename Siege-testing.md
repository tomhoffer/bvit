# Zaver: 
5 concurrentnych klientov naraz spravilo poziadavku. Iba prva z nich bola obsluzena, ostatne prekrocili rate 1r/s takze boli rejected. Dalsia vlna requestov prisla skor nez o jednu sekundu takze boli odmietnute tiez.

# Zaver
1r/s + 5 burst size znamena, ze 1 request prejde, dalsich 5 pojde do queue kde budu obsluzene neskor a requesty nad limit budu odmietnute

# Zaver
Zvyseny pocet concurrent connections presiahol burst rate a bol odmietnuty

# Default rate limiting + burst + delay  limit_req zone=myratelimit burst=5 delay=3
With this configuration, first 3 requests (delay) are passed without delay, next 2 requests (burst - delay) are delayed in such a way that the overall rate is not greater than specified, further excessive requests will be rejected because the total burst size has been exceeded, subsequent requests will be delayed.
